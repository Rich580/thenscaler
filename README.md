# thenscaler
Companion Repository for The N Scaler blog. A collection of Arduino code useful for Model Railroading, including function libraries and test code from the blog.

I'm using the "branches" feature to organize the site. When you click on "branch" (which is probably set to "master" when you first get here) you'll get a list of code branches I've put up so far. Select the branch of interest to access the code.

Quesions or comments can be posted at http://www.thenscaler.com.
